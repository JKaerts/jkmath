Inspired by the physics package on CTAN, this package defines some simple macros for mathematical notation which make the code more readable and/or allow flexibility in typesetting material.

The package is currently being developed as I gather examples of special notation fit for new macro's.

# Ideas for future versions

 * Lp-norms: A command `\lpnorm` that takes an optional value for p. This optional argument should default to 2. A second command `\supnorm` should take p equal to infinity.
 * Commands `\mono` and `\epi` for monomorphisms and epimorphisms.
